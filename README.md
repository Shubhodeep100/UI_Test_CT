This skills test demonstrates my capabilities for the front-end position at Coalition Technologies. The goal is to evaluate how I can convert an Adobe Photoshop file into a responsive single-page web application. Specifically, I must transform the provided PSD into a website that seamlessly adapts across screen sizes. This includes ensuring the carousel adjusts across devices and the tabs convert into a mobile-friendly accordion layout.

Additionally, I introduced internal links for the "History" and "Team" sections to improve navigation. I also incorporated a parallax scrolling effect on the hero image for enhanced user experience on desktop. Overall, this test will assess my skills in building a responsive, user-friendly website from a Photoshop design file. My aim is to demonstrate proficiency in responsive web development and adding value through intuitive navigation and scrolling effects.
